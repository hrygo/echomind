                        GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
 license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, designed to ensure freedom to share
 and change all versions of the work to safeguard it from becoming
 proprietary software.

 The licenses of most software and other practical works are designed to
 take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, our
 General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share
 and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.

 When we speak of free software, we mean freedom, not price. Our General
 Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
 distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish),
 that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can
 change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that
 you know you can do these things.

 Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your freedoms
 with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this
 License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
 modify the software.

 A secondary purpose of this License is to promote the development of
 free software and to avoid the danger that works based on a free
 program might become proprietary. To address this danger, we have made
 it stronger than the ordinary General Public License: it requires that
 a user who interacts with the modified software over a computer network
 be given an opportunity to receive the Corresponding Source.

 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.

                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 0. Definitions.

 "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public
 License.

 "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

 To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

 A "covered work" means either the Program or a work based on the Program.

 To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for copyright
 infringement, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private
 copy. Propagation includes copying, redistribution, reproduction,
 transmission, public performance, public display, developing, compiling,
 installing, and publicizing or advertising the work.

 To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not "conveyance".

 An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices" to
 the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature
 that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the
 user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the extent that
 warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the work under
 this License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the interface
 presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a prominent
 item in the list meets this requirement.

 1. Source Code.

 The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
 making modifications to it. "Object code" means any non-source form of
 a work.

 A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that is
 widely used among developers working in that language.

 The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and run the object code
 and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
 However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-
 purpose tools or generally available free programs which are used
 unmodified in performing those activities but which are not part of
 the work. For example, Corresponding Source includes interface
 definition files associated with source files, and the source code for
 shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work is
 specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data
 communication or control flow between those subprograms and other parts
 of the work.

 The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can
 regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

 The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same
 work.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable. This License explicitly
 affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The
 output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if
 the output, constituting a covered work, is licensed by the Program's
 Modified Version. You may make, run and propagate covered works that you
 do not convey, without condition so long as your license otherwise
 remains in force.

 You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
 them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with
 facilities for running a covered work, provided that you comply with
 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered work
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
 a copy of the Program. Ancillary interactive user interfaces for a
 covered work must display Appropriate Legal Notices, however.

 However, nothing grants you permission to violate copyright law if you
 do not accept this License.

 3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Third Party Perpetrators.

 If you convey a covered work, you waive all your legal rights to
 prohibit others from making modifications of the covered work for
 themselves, or to use for running the covered work, so long as they
 obtain the covered work for that purpose. This means that if you convey
 a covered work, you are explicitly granting permission to others to
 modify and run it for their own personal use, without any further
 obligations. In case you do not wish to grant such permissions, then
 you must abstain from conveying the covered work.

 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

 You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
 terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact
 all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a
 copy of this License along with the Program.

 You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and
 you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms
 of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

 a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
    and giving a relevant date.

 b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
    under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This
    requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact
    all notices".

 c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to
    anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will
    therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional
    terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of
    how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license
    the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
    permission if you have separately received it.

 d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

 A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such that they form a larger
 program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
 called an "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright
 are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's
 users to the covered work. Conveying an aggregate does not require
 this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.

 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of
 sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 Corresponding Source in a way which complies with the terms of
 this License.

 A Corresponding Source for a work in object code form must be conveyed
 in one of the following ways:

 a) Convey the object code in, or accompanied by, a copy of the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for program interchange.

 b) Convey the object code in, or accompanied by, a written offer, valid
    for at least three years and valid for as long as you offer
    spare parts or customer support for that product model, to give
    anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a copy of the
    Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is
    covered by this License, on a durable physical medium customarily
    used for program interchange, for a price no more than your
    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source,
    or (2) access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network
    server at no charge.

 c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    computer information and program that were provided to you in
    accord with section 4.

 d) Offer access to copy the object code from a designated place, and
    offer to provide the Corresponding Source by one of the methods
    above, to anyone who possesses the object code through that place.

 e) For a user who interacts with the modified software over a computer
    network, give that user an opportunity to receive the
    Corresponding Source by downloading from a network server at no
    charge, provided that you comply with these requirements for the
    entire work (including any modifications).

 A network server is one that makes publicly accessible computer
 information and program for copying.

 The Corresponding Source conveyed, and all object code forms of the
 work that are distributed, must be licensed under "this License".

 7. Additional Terms.

 "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as if they were included in this License's GNU Affero
 General Public License Version 3. To maintain a clear distinction
 between additional permissions and this License, these terms must be
 written separately, but if any conflict with any part of this License,
 the latter overrides.

 You may place additional permissions on material added by you to a
 covered work, provided that the additional permissions also fulfill the
 requirements of this License. If you add terms that are not additional
 permissions as defined above, then you must not include them as part of
 this License. For example, if you wish to add terms that you believe
 are necessary to protect your intellectual property in some parts of
 the work, you must include them as part of a separate legal document
 that is offered alongside this License.

 8. Termination.

 You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted to you by this
 License).

 However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license
 from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
 unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
 terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
 fails to notify you of the violation by any reasonable means prior to
 60 days after you cease the violation.

 Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
 permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by
 some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice
 of violation of this License (for any kind of work, by any copyright
 holder), and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your
 receipt of the notice.

 Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 patent licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you
 under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not
 permanently reinstated, you do not have permission to receive or run
 copies of the Program.

 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

 You are not required to accept this License to access or run a copy of
 the Program. Ancillary interactive user interfaces for a covered work
 must display Appropriate Legal Notices, however.

 However, nothing grants you permission to violate copyright law if you
 do not accept this License.

 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

 Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

 11. Patent License.

 Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 propagate the contents of the covered work.

 12. No Waiver.

 If you violate this License, and then you do not stop the violation,
 this does not mean that you have agreed to this License. Nothing in
 this section waives any patent or other legal rights that you may have
 in the covered work, so long as you have not explicitly agreed to this
 License.

 13. This License is only for the source code and object code of the
 covered work.

 You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run
 a copy of the Program. Ancillary interactive user interfaces for a
 covered work must display Appropriate Legal Notices, however.

 However, nothing grants you permission to violate copyright law if you
 do not accept this License.

 14. Limitation of Liability.

 IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES,
 INCLUDING ANY LOST PROFITS, LOST SAVINGS, OR OTHER INCIDENTAL OR
 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE,
 THE PROGRAM.

 15. Choice of Law.

 This License shall be governed by the laws of the United States of
 America, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

 16. Entire Agreement.

 This License constitutes the entire agreement between you and any
 copyright holders regarding the Program.

                           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
    possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
    free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
    terms.

    To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest
    to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
    state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
    the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
    found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
